Spaghetti Carbonara

This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water – we’re talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person – use whatever shape you’ve got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water. 

Ingredients
150 g dried spaghetti
2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon
1/2 tbsp olive oil
2 free-range eggs
30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating


Steps
1. Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.
2. Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.
3. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.
4. Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.
5. Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.
6. Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.
